     It's started when my PC is finally fixed. I can finally replace my old broken HDD. I was very happy, I can finally reuse my PC again. The PC is bundled with Windows 7 and some apps. Now, it's time to install some stuffs to the new fresh OS.

     I uninstalled antiviruses, strange app, cleaner app, unuseful app, then I install some apps, like Android SDK, .NET Framework 4.5, and of course, the only game I play on PC, osu!

     Then, It seems something still missing, even I already porting, some developing Android stuffs via Windows, I want.. something new, like.. building your own ROM, DualBootPatcher, etc. So I decided to install Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty

     After I downloaded and put the Ubuntu ISO to my Flash drive, now I'm going to boot and install it, I was in a surprise when installing it, It's very fast, it only takes around 5 minutes to install. Not like Windows, I already tried on some HDD, it takes 15-30 minutes to install, and Ubuntu is pretty easy to install.

     Now the OS finally installed, then I boot into Ubuntu, the interface is pretty simple, not hard to use, and pretty clean, even I'm going to only use GUI over 25% only, lol.

     Then, I open up terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) and install do stuff there, I wasn't confused with that, becouse I already have some knowledge about linux environment, even with 0 experience. I installed some stuff like git, etc. Then repo, then udev rules, and many more... And then I live mostly into Ubuntu everyday, with developing stuff and more, until today.
