Well, the last time I use is using the Freenom nameserver, from now on, I'm using CloudFlare as DNS, nameserver, etc, It should be a lil' bit different in some speed of the web, and you might meet some captcha from CloudFlare. Well, but there is something I kinda... disappointed with CloudFlare, Tumblr seems to not works with CloudFlare, so blog.rendyak.tk isn't work, but overall, it's pretty good, pretty satisfied with this.
